VIP I-natural

This is the current repository for VIP I-Natural team (Spring 2014). We want this Android app to be able to do 
activity recognition given (external) accelerometer data. This current version of the app does not do any machine learning
as of now. We are currently doing exploratory data analysis using Weka combined with a program I wrote to calculate features and
produce ARFF files.
